#### Day 1:

- Simulate slug density and soybean plant density for a set of experimental plots.
- Fit a linear regression model to the simulated data with known associations.
- Visualize the data and model.
- Assess whether the model correctly characterizes the simulated associations.

#### Day 2: 

- Fit a linear regression model to a new data set with an unknown association.
- Visualize the data and model.
- Assess the association between the independent and dependent variables in the data set.
